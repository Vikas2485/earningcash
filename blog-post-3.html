    <h2>1. Play with a Squad</h2>
    <p>Always queue with a full squad of trusted players to improve communication and chances of winning.</p>

    <h2>2. Choose Safe Drop Zones</h2>
    <p>Avoid hot drops early in the match. Survive longer to gain rank points even with low kills.</p>

    <h2>3. Master Two Main Guns</h2>
    <p>Stick to two weapons (e.g. MP40 and M1014) and become a beast with them. Consistency beats randomness.</p>

    <h2>4. Use Headphones</h2>
    <p>Listen for footsteps and enemy fire to stay alert and react first during fights.</p>

    <h2>5. Daily Warm-up</h2>
    <p>Spend 15 minutes in training grounds to warm up your reflexes and improve aim before ranked matches.</p>
